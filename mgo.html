<h2> Wow you scrolled to the bottom... ok here is a "game manipulate trick" for the game.</h2><BR><BR>

<p>A new <strong>Monopoly Go airplane mode</strong> hack has been found after the February 2024 patch fixed the original. The old version of the airplane mode trick involved turning on the feature before rolling and then quitting out of the game, reinstalling the app or deleting the cache, before going back into the auto-save. Unfortunately, this method has been patched by Scopely, possibly after too many people used it to gain huge dice banks, top scores in tournament leaderboards, and rushing through events with blistering speed. This is why many players have reported that this is not working anymore.</p>
<p>However, a few players have noticed that the game now uses predetermined rolls. The explanation of how this works in terms of gameplay is a bit complicated and using airplane mode takes more effort, but it can still be done. Here’s how the new airplane mode cheat works for Monopoly Go on iOS and Android for the newly patched version of the game. </p>
<h2>How to use new Monopoly Go airplane mode hack</h2>
<p>To explain the new Monopoly Go airplane mode hack after the February 2024 patch, it may be better to list the steps first on how this cheat works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set your dice multiplier to x100, or x1000 if you have a High Roller boost</li>
<li>Turn on airplane mode and get ready to roll alongside a notepad and a pencil</li>
<li>Write down or record what rolls you get until the “No Internet” message prompt appears on the screen. The more rolls you get, the better. You can memorize the list of rolls as well if you want or use a screen recorder for accuracy. (For this example, let’s take 4, 8, 11, 3, 7, and 10 as the list of rolls and x1000 as the dice multiplier.)</li>
<li>Close the app. If you’re on Apple, you need to delete the game entirely and redownload it from the Apple Store. If you’re on Android, you can head to the system settings for storage, find Monopoly Go under apps, and then delete the cache and storage. This step should be familiar to anyone who used the former airplane mode trick.</li>
<li>Re-open the app and log into your linked Facebook account for the auto-save.</li>
<li>Check to see if the first number on the list (in this example, that’s a 4) is what you need to have your token land on whatever space you want it to land on. If yes, go ahead and roll at x1000 to land on it. If not, roll at a x1 multiplier and move onto the next number.</li>
<li>Continue to repeat Step 6 until you run out of numbers of your x1000 list.</li>
<li>Go back to Step 1 and repeat the process as you wish.</li>
</ol>
<p>How this airplane mode works for Monopoly Go is based on the fact that the game now uses predetermined rolls with each dice multiplier having its own set of rolls. Rolling once moves all of these sets over by one.</p>
<p>To take the above example, let’s say you don’t need the 4 as the first number on the x1000 list. Then you can roll at a x1 multiplier once and advance the queue to the next number on the list, which is an 8. It doesn’t really matter what you roll on the x1, though sometimes it will have you reach a space you wanted.</p>
<p>Compared to the old airplane mode trick, this one definitely takes more work. But since the rolls are predetermined, it’s easier to pull off. The older trick was random so it’s possible that you can spend ten minutes of High Roller without getting the roll you want. Here, you know what you are going to get, so you can advance around the board and land on what you want for a longer time before you have to perform the trick again. That said, a 5-minute High Roller may not be a lot of time for you to pull this trick off before it ends, so you’ll have to be quick and hope for some good luck.</p>
